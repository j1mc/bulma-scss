# bulma-scss

This is a port of the [Bulma](https://bulma.io/) project SASS files to the SCSS syntax.

These files are based on Bulma versions up through Bulma 0.9.4. With the release of Bulma 1.0,
Bulma changed to supporting SCSS natively, thus eliminating the need for this project.

These files will remain available for anyone who needs them, but the project is now archived.
